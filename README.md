I started my software development career with training at Piksel Akademi. Today, at the same company, I serve as a Lead .NET Developer & Project Manager, building ASP.NET Core–based web and CRM projects and teaching software development courses. I have taken an active role in projects for corporate clients, including Paloma Hotels and Süral Su.
