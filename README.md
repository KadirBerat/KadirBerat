I started my career with software training at [Piksel Akademi](https://pikselakademi.com.tr/) and then worked as a .NET Developer. During this time, I participated in various web and mobile application projects. I also interned at Piksel Akademi as a .NET Developer while completing my undergraduate education.

Currently, I am a Lead .NET Developer & Project Manager at Piksel Akademi. I am developing [Kadesh Chain](https://www.kadeshchain.com/)'s web and documentation sites and contributing to other projects.

I have experience with .NET technologies (Web, Mobile, API, WCF Service, Windows Forms) and strong knowledge of C#. I have developed mobile applications using Xamarin.Forms and recently started using MAUI. I also have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

For databases, I mainly use Microsoft SQL Server. I have good experience with SQLite for mobile projects and moderate experience with Azure Cosmos DB. I have basic knowledge of MongoDB and PostgreSQL, and limited experience with IBM Db2. I use Domain Driven Design, CQRS, and Mediator patterns in my projects. I manage CI/CD processes with Azure DevOps and work on real-time development with SignalR.
